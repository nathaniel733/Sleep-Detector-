Context
In today's fast-paced world, driver fatigue is a significant contributor to road accidents, often leading to severe consequences for drivers and passengers alike. The Sleep Detector project addresses this pressing issue by providing an innovative solution to monitor and enhance driver alertness. This system utilizes advanced sensors and algorithms to detect signs of drowsiness in real-time, ensuring that drivers receive timely alerts before fatigue affects their performance on the road.

By employing technologies such as eye-tracking and head position monitoring, the Sleep Detector can accurately identify fatigue levels. When drowsiness is detected, the system triggers audible or visual alerts to prompt the driver to take necessary action, such as resting or pulling over. This project not only aims to improve driver safety but also emphasizes the importance of preventive measures in the transportation industry.

The Sleep Detector can be integrated into various vehicles, from personal cars to commercial fleets, making it a versatile tool for enhancing road safety across different driving environments. Through this project, we aim to contribute to safer driving practices and reduce the incidence of fatigue-related accidents on the roads.
